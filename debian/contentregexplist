#Content modifying Regular Expressions
#
# The format is: "extended regular expression"->"replacement straight string"
# E.g. "shit"->"censored" would replace all occurrences of shit in any case.
# Far more complicated matches are possible.  See other sources for examples
# of extended regular expressions.

# These are just some weak examples.  If you write any, for example, to
# remove popups etc, please send them to author at dansguardian.org.

#"<script language.*open\(.*script>"->"<!-- its gone -->"
#"fuck|cunt|shit|arse"->"**censored**"
