dansguardian (2.9.9.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This is the first upload of the new dansguardian 2.9 tree. It changes
  several things: 

  - there is no loger a patch needed for antivirussupport. Unfortunately
    that means that the old configuration syntax is not valid any more. 
    On the other hand this version has support for icap and
    commandlinescanners. For configuration details see
    /etc/dansguardian/contentscanners. 

  - Nearly all configuration files were moved to /etc/dansguardian/lists. 
    I did my beѕt to made the migration as painless as possible. But if you 
    renamed filterfiles or had custom ones they could not get moved
    automatically. Please look into /etc/dansguardian/lists and
    /etc/dansguardian⁄dansgardianf1.conf how to integrate them into
    Dansguardian 2.9. 

  - Since there were so many changes and new features its recommended to
    start with a new config (this means dansguardian.conf and
    dansguardianf1.conf, not your filter files). An automatic migration is
    unfortunately not possible.

dansguardian (2.8.0.6-antivirus-6.3.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  I included Aecio F. Neto antiviruspatch for dansguardian, this makes it
  possible to scan websites and file for viruses using the clamav engine. 
  You will have to adapt your config with the new antivirus options. See
  /usr/share/doc/README.AV for more informations. 
  Its not possible to use clamd or kapersky antivirus with the debian package,
  because the code has to be patched to get another engine working.
